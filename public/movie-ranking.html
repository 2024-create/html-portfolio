<h1>My top three Movies of all time</h1>
<h2>by Felix</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Divergent</h3>
<p>It shows a different approach how a society can work, without any democracy, dictatorship or aristocrazy.</p>
<h3>Hunger Games The Mockingbird part one</h3> 
<p>Just the song hit me really hard emotionally and seeing the workers unite for one purpose.</p>
<h3>Rush Hour 2</h3>
<p>It is just funny and entertaining. The plot is just there so you have a story to tell.</p>
